      Hi my name is Denise Anderson and I am 23 years old and I live in Denver, Colorado. I grew up in good ol Pueblo, Colorado which is known as the black hole of Colorado. 
      Growing up I was constantly outside swimming or playing with the kids on the block. I have a twin sister so we were always together. However my twin sister and I are polar opposites. 
      Usually on my spare time I am at a concet. I spend more money than I have on concert tickets but oh well. I currently work as a Data Anylyst at Lutheran Hospital.
      Before I moved to Denver I managed a tanning salon and I honestly loved it.
